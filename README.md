# Strategy-Multiplayer game prototype

1vs1 online prototype made in Unity mixing elements of Clash Royale, RTS (you can directly command your heroes) and MOBA (lane minions), to familiarize myself with netcode concepts. It uses the new multiplayer solution [Netcode for Gameobjects](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about), still in preview at the moment of writting this.
